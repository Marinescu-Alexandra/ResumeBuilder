WORK IN PROGRESS

Barebones backend implementation for tokenizing latex files to automatically generate resumes. Sample resume is taken and modified from https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv. To run locally, you must install bibtex and run all its updates (docker image may be created in the future for ease of use).
